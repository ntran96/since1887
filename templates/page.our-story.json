With the help of his family, he finally achieved that vision.\n <br>\n<br>\nIn the summer of 1886, with his seven sons and two daughters by his side, William set out to fulfil a lifelong ambition. Together they began building his Distillery by hand, stone by stone. After a single year of work it was ready and William named it Glenfiddich, Gaelic for Valley of the Deer.\n <br>\n<br>\nWilliam’s passion, determination and pioneering spirit continues to guide us today. Glenfiddich is one of the few single malt distilleries to remain entirely family owned and is now the World's Most Awarded Single Malt* Scotch Whisky, a true reflection of our founder’s innovative nature, passed down through the generations."
